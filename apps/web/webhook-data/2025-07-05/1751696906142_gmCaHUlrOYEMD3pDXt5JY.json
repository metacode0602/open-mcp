If you know React, Python or ML model deployment, please reach out to weixuanfu01@gmail.com We want to make it easy to **manage, share and deploy** ComfyUI project.\n\n## Upcoming Features\n\n1. 1-Click Install Models\n   Often when you import a json workflow from online, it will show lots of missing nodes or models errors, we will provide easy one-click install for missing models from Hugging face and Civiti\n\n2. Modular\n   Modern software development project are all modularized, the whole system is broken down into different modules. In ComfyUI each custom node is a module and should be self contained and easy to install and depend on from other modules. So that the modules (custom nodes) can be easily reused across projects.\n   ➡️ We need something like web bundler, e.g. webpack, vite. This will make each custom node self contained and has a clear definition of its dependency.\n\n3. Multi workflow project\n   Now you can only work on one workflow at a time, this limits the potential to build large scale workflows that consists multiple sub-workflows parts. Each workflow can be seen as a custom node. You should be able to easily convert one workflow into one custom node. You can reuse workflow/custom node across your project.\n   ➡️ We need a cross workflow, project management tool, like VSCode editor\n\n4. Cloud running / easy deployment\n   Right now you need to have python and GPU server up to run ComfyUI or Automatic111, that’s really painful for people who do not own a GPU. You should be able to run UI independently without paying for GPU💰.\n   ➡️ Share and deploy your workflow to cloud in 1click and other people can easily run in browser using cloud GPU with no setup. It should be as easy as running Google Docs or Figma.\n\n## Beta Preview\n\nWe're constantly pushing new features in beta branch. Here is how to switch to beta branch to receive latest feature updates pre-launch! It requires you have some basic knowledge about command line and git.\n\n- Make sure you have [git installed](https://git-scm.com/downloads)\n- Open your terminal, go to the ComfyUI folder (where you do `python main.py`)\n- in ComfyUI root directory, `cd custom_nodes && cd comfyui-workspace-manager`\n- inside custom_nodes/comfyui-workspace-manager, do `git fetch origin beta && git checkout beta`, you should see something like:\n\n```\nFrom https://github.com/11cafe/comfyui-workspace-manager\n * branch            beta       -> FETCH_HEAD\nSwitched to branch 'beta'\nYour branch is up to date with 'origin/beta'.\n```\n\n- Restart ComfyUI python server by `python main.py`\n\n‼️ Be careful that beta branch can be unstable, so please please make sure you have backups for all your workflows! **Before switching to beta, please make a copy of these folders somewhere:**\n\n`ComfyUI/custom_nodes/comfyui-workspace-manager/db`\nor the entire `ComfyUI/custom_nodes/comfyui-workspace-manager/` folder\n\nif anything goes wrong, you can always paste back these folders. Also, you should have your /my_workflows folder (workspace save directory) in safe place always\n\nTo revert back to main:\n\n- inside custom_nodes/comfyui-workspace-manager, do `git checkout main`, then restart your python server and you are back into main branch!\n\n## Credits\n\nComfyUI: https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI\n\nComfyUI Browser: https://github.com/talesofai/comfyui-browser (Media display code for reference)\nAnd thanks to all custom node creators building the community!\n\n## Dev\n\n1. Clone ComfyUI\n   `git clone https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI`\n   follow the install and setup instructions of ComfyUI README\n2. Clone Workspace Manager\n   in /ComfyUI folder\n\n```\ncd custom_nodes && git clone https://github.com/11cafe/comfyui-workspace-manager.git\n```\n\n3. npm install\n   inside `/ComfyUI/custom_nodes/comfyui-workspace-manager`\n   do `cd ui && npm install`\n   this will install all node dependencies\n4. build and run\n   inside `/ComfyUI/custom_nodes/comfyui-workspace-manager/ui`\n   `npm run build --watch`\n   this command will watch for your file changes and automatically rebuild, you just need to refresh to see your changes in browser everyting you change some code\n5. run ComfyUI server\n   inside `/ComfyUI`\n   do `python main.py` or `python3 main.py` depending on your version\n\n#### IndexDB trouble shooting\n\nIf you see indexdb version mismatch error in console that looks like:\n\n```\nVersionError: The requested version (10) is less than the existing version (30).\"\nname\n:\n\"DatabaseClosedError\"\n```\n\nplease delete indexdb manually F12 Dev tools -> Application -> IndexDB -> WorkspaceManagerDB\n<img width=\"460\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-01-21 at 11 21 55 PM\" src=\"https://zenly.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/mcp/repos/11cafe/comfyui-workspace-manager/readme-images/1751696879744.png\">\n\nand delete localstorage.WORKSPACE_INDEXDB_BACKFILL\n<img width=\"460\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-01-21 at 11 29 02 PM\" src=\"https://zenly.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/mcp/repos/11cafe/comfyui-workspace-manager/readme-images/1751696883837.png\">\n\nonly do this if you are a developer\n",

If you know React, Python or ML model deployment, please reach out to weixuanfu01@gmail.com We want to make it easy to **manage, share and deploy** ComfyUI project.\n\n## Upcoming Features\n\n1. 1-Click Install Models\n   Often when you import a json workflow from online, it will show lots of missing nodes or models errors, we will provide easy one-click install for missing models from Hugging face and Civiti\n\n2. Modular\n   Modern software development project are all modularized, the whole system is broken down into different modules. In ComfyUI each custom node is a module and should be self contained and easy to install and depend on from other modules. So that the modules (custom nodes) can be easily reused across projects.\n   ➡️ We need something like web bundler, e.g. webpack, vite. This will make each custom node self contained and has a clear definition of its dependency.\n\n3. Multi workflow project\n   Now you can only work on one workflow at a time, this limits the potential to build large scale workflows that consists multiple sub-workflows parts. Each workflow can be seen as a custom node. You should be able to easily convert one workflow into one custom node. You can reuse workflow/custom node across your project.\n   ➡️ We need a cross workflow, project management tool, like VSCode editor\n\n4. Cloud running / easy deployment\n   Right now you need to have python and GPU server up to run ComfyUI or Automatic111, that’s really painful for people who do not own a GPU. You should be able to run UI independently without paying for GPU💰.\n   ➡️ Share and deploy your workflow to cloud in 1click and other people can easily run in browser using cloud GPU with no setup. It should be as easy as running Google Docs or Figma.\n\n## Beta Preview\n\nWe're constantly pushing new features in beta branch. Here is how to switch to beta branch to receive latest feature updates pre-launch! It requires you have some basic knowledge about command line and git.\n\n- Make sure you have [git installed](https://git-scm.com/downloads)\n- Open your terminal, go to the ComfyUI folder (where you do `python main.py`)\n- in ComfyUI root directory, `cd custom_nodes && cd comfyui-workspace-manager`\n- inside custom_nodes/comfyui-workspace-manager, do `git fetch origin beta && git checkout beta`, you should see something like:\n\n```\nFrom https://github.com/11cafe/comfyui-workspace-manager\n * branch            beta       -> FETCH_HEAD\nSwitched to branch 'beta'\nYour branch is up to date with 'origin/beta'.\n```\n\n- Restart ComfyUI python server by `python main.py`\n\n‼️ Be careful that beta branch can be unstable, so please please make sure you have backups for all your workflows! **Before switching to beta, please make a copy of these folders somewhere:**\n\n`ComfyUI/custom_nodes/comfyui-workspace-manager/db`\nor the entire `ComfyUI/custom_nodes/comfyui-workspace-manager/` folder\n\nif anything goes wrong, you can always paste back these folders. Also, you should have your /my_workflows folder (workspace save directory) in safe place always\n\nTo revert back to main:\n\n- inside custom_nodes/comfyui-workspace-manager, do `git checkout main`, then restart your python server and you are back into main branch!\n\n## Credits\n\nComfyUI: https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI\n\nComfyUI Browser: https://github.com/talesofai/comfyui-browser (Media display code for reference)\nAnd thanks to all custom node creators building the community!\n\n## Dev\n\n1. Clone ComfyUI\n   `git clone https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI`\n   follow the install and setup instructions of ComfyUI README\n2. Clone Workspace Manager\n   in /ComfyUI folder\n\n```\ncd custom_nodes && git clone https://github.com/11cafe/comfyui-workspace-manager.git\n```\n\n3. npm install\n   inside `/ComfyUI/custom_nodes/comfyui-workspace-manager`\n   do `cd ui && npm install`\n   this will install all node dependencies\n4. build and run\n   inside `/ComfyUI/custom_nodes/comfyui-workspace-manager/ui`\n   `npm run build --watch`\n   this command will watch for your file changes and automatically rebuild, you just need to refresh to see your changes in browser everyting you change some code\n5. run ComfyUI server\n   inside `/ComfyUI`\n   do `python main.py` or `python3 main.py` depending on your version\n\n#### IndexDB trouble shooting\n\nIf you see indexdb version mismatch error in console that looks like:\n\n```\nVersionError: The requested version (10) is less than the existing version (30).\"\nname\n:\n\"DatabaseClosedError\"\n```\n\nplease delete indexdb manually F12 Dev tools -> Application -> IndexDB -> WorkspaceManagerDB\n<img width=\"460\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-01-21 at 11 21 55 PM\" src=\"https://zenly.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/mcp/repos/11cafe/comfyui-workspace-manager/readme-images/1751696879744.png\">\n\nand delete localstorage.WORKSPACE_INDEXDB_BACKFILL\n<img width=\"460\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-01-21 at 11 29 02 PM\" src=\"https://zenly.oss-cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/mcp/repos/11cafe/comfyui-workspace-manager/readme-images/1751696883837.png\">\n\nonly do this if you are a developer\n",
